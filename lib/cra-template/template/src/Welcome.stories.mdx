# Welcome to storybook

This is a UI component dev environment for your app.

We've added some basic stories inside the `src/` directory.  
A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.  
(Basically a story is like a visual test case.)

See this sample story for a component called Button.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="to Storybook">
    <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>Hello Button</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

Just like that, you can add your own components as stories.  
You can also edit those components and see changes right away.  
(Try editing this story located at `src/Welcome.stories.mdx`.)

Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.  
Have a look at the [Writing Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/) section in our documentation.
