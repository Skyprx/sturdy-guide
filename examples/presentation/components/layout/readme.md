# About layout components

Share your layout components so other developers can re-use it, and not waste hours re-implementing CSS things all the time.

Also this readme file is just to show off how storybook can read markdown files and show them in a 'Notes' panel.

> Storybook will introduce a docs-view mode in version ~'5.0.0'.

This would bring the ability to create really rich docs pages with isolated components interleaved with docs.
